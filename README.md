# JSH Theme built with Slate

> **[Dev Shop](https://juice-served-here.myshopify.com/)** Please contact me for store front access.

## Notes to Zehner:

- Theme responsive development based on [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) responsive front-end framework; CDN links only used to load Foundation's CSS and JS for quick prototyping purposes, but otherwise it should be package controlled.
- As mentioned before, I have used other development methods similar to Slate when developing Shopify themes. This is my first try using Slate, so it's still very much a learning experience.
- I tried to utilize Shopify sections as much as I can during development of this project, but due to time constraint some parts are still hardcoded. Thanks for your understanding. Please ask me for Shopify admin access if you wish to see the theme sections set up.
